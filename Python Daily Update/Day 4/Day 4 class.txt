--------------- Python Strings ---------------


Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
Multiline Strings

print("""Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
When the blazing sun is gone,
When he nothing shines upon,
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
Then the trav'ller in the dark,
Thanks you for your tiny spark,
He couldn't see which way to go,
If you did not twinkle so""");

--------------- String Length ---------------
To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

a="asdfgh"
print(len(a))

--------------- Python - Slicing Strings ---------------
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.
(start,end)
Note: The first character has index 0.

Slice From the Start
By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])

Slice To the End
By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:
Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end:

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])

Negative Indexing
Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
Example
Get the characters:

From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)

To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])

Python - Modify Strings
Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.

--------------- Upper Case---------------
ExampleGet your own Python Server
The upper() method returns the string in upper case:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.upper())

--------------- Lower Case ---------------
Example
The lower() method returns the string in lower case:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())


--------------- Remove Whitespace ---------------
Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.

Example
The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:

a = " Hello, World! "
print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"
