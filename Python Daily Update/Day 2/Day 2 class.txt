---------------- Python Variables ----------------
Variables are containers for storing data values.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
ex:=

s = "sanket"
P = 9
print(S)     #output=sanket

print(P)     #output=9

Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

NOT USED=
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
ex:=

s = "sanket"
s = 9
print(S)

#output=9


s1 ===r1 ==="sanket"
s1===r2====9
