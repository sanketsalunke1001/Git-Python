====================== LOGIC BUILDING QUESTIONS ==============

--------------- For Loops ---------------
Print all prime numbers between 1 and 100 using a for loop.

Write a program to print a multiplication table for a number entered by the user.

Count and display how many vowels are in a given string using a for loop.

Print a pattern like this using a for loop:
*
**
***
****


Write a program to reverse a string without using slicing, only with a for loop.

Create a list of 10 numbers and print the sum of only even numbers using for loop and continue.

Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the first 15 numbers using for loop.

--------------- While Loops ---------------
Keep asking the user for input until they type "exit", then stop using a while loop.

Write a program to check if a number is an Armstrong number, using a while loop.

Find the factorial of a number using a while loop.

Use a while loop to keep dividing a number by 2 until it becomes less than 1, and print the number of divisions.

Write a program that keeps asking for a password until the correct password ("python123") is entered.

--------------- Using break, continue, pass ---------------
Write a program to display numbers from 1 to 50, but stop the loop if the number is divisible by both 3 and 7 using break.

Print all numbers between 1 and 30, skipping those that are divisible by 4 using continue.

Write a program where pass is used inside a loop as a placeholder for a future feature (e.g., add a feature later when the number is negative).


--------------- Combination of All Concepts ---------------

--------------- ATM Simulation ---------------

Start with an account balance (e.g., â‚¹5000).

Menu-driven using while loop:

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Check balance

Exit

Use break to exit, continue for invalid choices, and pass for a "loan feature coming soon".


--------------- Simple Quiz Game ---------------

Ask 5 multiple-choice questions.

For each wrong answer, print "Wrong! Try again." and continue to the next question.

If the user types "quit", break the game.

Use pass for a future "hint system".


--------------- Pattern Printing Tool ---------------

User chooses from 3 patterns (triangle, square, pyramid).

Use for loops to generate the patterns.

Use continue to skip invalid sizes and break if the user chooses "exit".



--------------- Library Book Borrowing System ---------------

A list of available books is displayed.

User can borrow, return, or view books.

break to exit the system.

continue when the user enters a wrong book name.
